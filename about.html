                This is a self-assessment webapp.  It's designed to help the user run experiments
                about their daily lives.  The experiments run by this webapp don't need any fancy
                machinery or special knowledge.  To run a successful experiment a user only has to
                follow instructions and a schedule.
            </p>

                You may wonder what kind of experiments we can run just using a website.  When most
                people think of experiments they think of research labs, or hospitals, or social surveys that
                sample people from across the country.  Those experiments are big and complicated
                because the scientists who run them are aiming for general truth -- they want to prove
                something about everyone everywhere (or close to it :) ).  Our website will be
                focused on a much smaller scale : you!  With this website and a little work, you'll be
                able to find out all sorts of things about yourself, and it won't be very difficult.
            </p>
            <h2>Self-assessment Webapp . . . Version 0.1.0</h2>
            <p>
                There are a lot of interesting questions you can answer with a webapp like this.  Some
                good self-assessment question examples :
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>Does taking Melatonin help me sleep better?</li>
                <li>Does the weather have a big impact on my mood?</li>
                <li>Does listening to music while I work hurt my productivity?</li>
                <li>Does eating breakfast in the morning improve my ability to focus?</li>
            </ol>
            <p>
                It's not hard to come up with these: you only need an object of your curiousity and a way to
                measure it.  Those questions were some of my motivating examples when building
                this webapp.  Unfortunately, the webapp is far from complete : we'll be below version 1
                until I finish learning JavaScript.  For now, the only question this webapp can help you answer
                is number 4.  Continue reading to see how it works!

            <h2>Getting Started</h2>
            <p>
                The first thing you'll need to do is create an account, but this is done automatically when you create
                a new assessment schedule.  You first stop, then, should be the New Schedule link.  Once you've created
                a schedule, be sure to stop back by the
                Welcome page.  You'll get your daily intervention instructions there.  Afterwards,
                head to the SART (Sustained Attention to Response Task) Assessment page and read through the tutorial.
                Don't worry -- the site will explain what SART is once you're there.  After you do the tutorial, you're done for now.  
                Just regularly check back
                in at the appropriate times, follow the instructions, and complete the SART assessmenets.  Your results
                will be viewable once your schedule is over.
